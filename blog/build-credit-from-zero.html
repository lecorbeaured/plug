        <p>Building credit from scratch can feel overwhelming, but it's one of the most important financial steps you'll take. Your credit score affects everything from loan approvals to apartment rentals and even job opportunities. Let's break down exactly how to build credit when you're starting from zero.</p>

        <h2>Why Credit Matters</h2>
        <p>Your credit score is a three-digit number that tells lenders how responsible you are with borrowed money. It ranges from 300 to 850, with higher scores unlocking better interest rates, higher credit limits, and more financial opportunities.</p>

        <p>Without credit history, you're essentially invisible to the financial system. This guide will show you how to become visible and build a strong credit foundation.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Step 1: Get a Secured Credit Card</h2>
        <p>A secured credit card is the easiest way to start building credit. Unlike regular credit cards, secured cards require a refundable security deposit (usually $200-$500) that becomes your credit limit.</p>

        <p><strong>Best secured cards for beginners:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Discover it¬Æ Secured:</strong> No annual fee, cash back rewards, and Discover reports to all three credit bureaus</li>
          <li><strong>Capital One Platinum Secured:</strong> Low deposit options starting at $49-$200 for a $200 credit line</li>
          <li><strong>Chime Credit Builder:</strong> No deposit required, no interest, no fees</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 2: Become an Authorized User</h2>
        <p>Ask a family member or trusted friend with good credit to add you as an authorized user on their credit card. You'll benefit from their positive payment history without being responsible for the bill.</p>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Make sure the primary cardholder has excellent payment history and keeps their balance low. Their bad habits can hurt your credit too.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Consider a Credit Builder Loan</h2>
        <p>Credit builder loans are specifically designed for people with no credit history. You make monthly payments into a savings account, and once the loan is paid off, you get the money back. Meanwhile, your payments are reported to credit bureaus.</p>

        <p>Popular options include Self, Credit Strong, and many credit unions offer credit builder programs.</p>

        <div class="alert-info">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> You don't need to do all three methods at once. Start with one or two and build from there. The key is consistent, on-time payments.
        </div>

        <h2>The Golden Rules of Building Credit</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Pay on time, every time:</strong> Payment history is 35% of your credit score. Set up autopay to never miss a due date.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep balances low:</strong> Use less than 30% of your credit limit. Lower is better. This is called credit utilization.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't close old accounts:</strong> Length of credit history matters. Keep your oldest accounts open.</li>
          <li><strong>Limit new applications:</strong> Each credit application creates a hard inquiry. Too many hurt your score.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor your credit:</strong> Use free services like Credit Karma or Experian to track your progress.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline: What to Expect</h2>
        <p>Building credit takes time, but you'll start seeing results faster than you think:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Month 1-3:</strong> Your first credit account appears on your credit report</li>
          <li><strong>Month 6:</strong> You'll have enough history to generate a FICO score (typically 620-680 range)</li>
          <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> With good habits, you can reach a 700+ score</li>
          <li><strong>Year 2+:</strong> Your credit profile strengthens, unlocking better financial products</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <p>Don't sabotage your credit-building journey with these rookie mistakes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Missing payments (even one late payment can drop your score 100+ points)</li>
          <li>Maxing out your credit cards</li>
          <li>Applying for too many cards at once</li>
          <li>Ignoring your credit reports (check them annually at AnnualCreditReport.com)</li>
          <li>Falling for credit repair scams (you can do everything they do for free)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ready to Start Building?</h2>
        <p>Building credit from zero is completely doable with the right approach. Start with one secured card, make small purchases, pay them off in full each month, and watch your credit score grow. Remember, it's a marathon, not a sprint.</p>

        <p>The best time to start building credit was yesterday. The second best time is today. Choose your first step and get started!</p>
