## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Analytics & Monetization

**Google Analytics (GA4):**
1. Create a Google Analytics 4 property at https://analytics.google.com
2. Get your Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
3. Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` in ALL HTML files with your actual ID
4. Test by visiting your site and checking Real-Time reports in GA

**Google AdSense:**
1. Apply for AdSense at https://www.google.com/adsense
2. Get your publisher ID (format: ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX)
3. Replace `ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` in ALL HTML files with your actual ID
4. Replace ad slot IDs (`data-ad-slot="1234567890"`) with your actual slot IDs
5. Wait for approval (typically 1-2 weeks with quality content)

### 2. Setup Newsletter/Email

The newsletter form is ready but needs a backend. Choose one:

**Option A: Mailchimp**
```javascript
// In js/main.js, replace simulateNewsletterSignup() with:
async function subscribeToMailchimp(email) {
  const response = await fetch('YOUR_MAILCHIMP_API_ENDPOINT', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ email: email })
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

**Option B: ConvertKit**
```javascript
async function subscribeToConvertKit(email) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.convertkit.com/v3/forms/YOUR_FORM_ID/subscribe', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      api_key: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      email: email
    })
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

**Option C: Custom Backend**
Create a serverless function (Netlify, Vercel, AWS Lambda) to handle signups.

### 3. Legal Compliance

**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
1. ⚠️ Review ALL legal pages with a qualified attorney
2. Update `[YOUR JURISDICTION]` placeholders in Terms of Service
3. Add your actual contact email addresses
4. Ensure compliance with:
   - GDPR (if you have EU visitors)
   - CCPA (if you have California visitors)
   - FTC guidelines for affiliate disclosure
   - Financial content regulations in your jurisdiction

**Consider adding:**
- Cookie consent banner (required in EU)
- GDPR-compliant data processing agreement
- Affiliate disclosure on every page with affiliate links
